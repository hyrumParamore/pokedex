# Pokémon Card Creator

<!-- {Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->
Creating this Web App has been a idea of mine for a while now. I came up with the idea when I was taking a class learning JavaScript and had the basic outline and idea for the project but didn't have the time or talent to finish it. Now that I have learned a lot more in the past few years and I wanted to test my skills and develope a working prototype that I can further develope.

<!-- {Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.} -->
This web app is pretty simple when looking at it from a user perspective, but looking a little deeper, it has a little more complexity built into it. This web app is a Pokémon card creator. You type in the Pokémon that you would like a card made for and it will then populate the card below.
To start the program, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). With that you will then need to clone this repository, and then have to run a few commands to get everything set up. 
This website has some useful tips on creating a Web App, but could also be useful starting a test server [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-react-with-create-react-app/).


<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->
The purpose for writing this software was more of a challenge for myself to see what I could accomplish with what I at this point in my life. I also am a huge fan of Pokémon and love the card game as well as the video games! I thought it would be fun to mix two of my favorite things together and see what happens! I have other plans that I want to incorporate into this project including deck building, more customization with the cards, and possibly even battles with the cards! I will have to save those for a future project and time. 

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.} -->

# Web Pages

<!-- {Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.} -->
I currently only have one web page for this but am looking to add more when I have more time available. As of now, this project doesn't really require more than a single page to run correctly, but again, I am looking to add more in the future.

# Future Work

<!-- {Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.} -->
* Make it printable.
* Add more cards and be able to create a deck.
* Make the cards more customizable and work better with the different abilities and moves that each Pokémon has.
